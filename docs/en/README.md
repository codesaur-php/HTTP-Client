# codesaur/http-client

A lightweight, object-oriented HTTP client component for sending HTTP requests and processing/sending MIME emails.

---

## Key Features

- **CurlClient** - Flexible HTTP client based on cURL  
- **JSONClient** - Convenient for working with REST APIs with JSON data  
- **Mail** - MIME email sender with HTML + Text + multiple attachments  
- Full UTF-8 support (names, file names, headers, etc.)  
- Lightweight, fast, can be used on any framework or standalone  
- Only requires `ext-curl` and `ext-json`  

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require codesaur/http-client
```

---

# 1. CurlClient - General HTTP Client

```php
use codesaur\Http\Client\CurlClient;

$curl = new CurlClient();

$response = $curl->request(
    'https://httpbin.org/get',
    'GET'
);

echo $response;
```

---

# 2. JSONClient - Working with JSON APIs

**Note:** JSONClient configures SSL verification based on the `CODESAUR_APP_ENV` environment variable:
- SSL verification is disabled in `development` environment (suitable for development)
- SSL verification is enabled in `production` or other environments (secure)

```bash
# .env file or environment variable
CODESAUR_APP_ENV=development  # or production
```

### GET Request

```php
use codesaur\Http\Client\JSONClient;

$client = new JSONClient();

$response = $client->get(
    'https://httpbin.org/get',
    ['hello' => 'world']
);

print_r($response);
```

### POST Request

```php
$response = $client->post(
    'https://httpbin.org/post',
    ['test' => 'codesaur']
);

echo $response['json']['test']; // codesaur
```

### Error Response Structure

```json
{
  "error": { "code": 123, "message": "An error occurred..." }
}
```

---

# 3. Mail - MIME HTML + Attachment Email Client

### Sending Simple HTML Email

```php
use codesaur\Http\Client\Mail;

$mail = new Mail();

$mail->targetTo('user@example.com', 'User');
$mail->setFrom('no-reply@example.com', 'codesaur');
$mail->setSubject('Hello!');
$mail->setMessage('<h1>Hello!</h1><p>Test email.</p>');

$mail->sendMail();
```

### Adding Attachments

```php
$mail->addFileAttachment(__DIR__ . '/file.pdf');
$mail->addUrlAttachment('https://example.com/logo.png');
$mail->addContentAttachment("Hello world", "note.txt");
```

### Multiple Recipients

```php
$mail->addRecipient('a@example.com', 'Person A');
$mail->addCCRecipient('b@example.com', 'Person B');
$mail->addBCCRecipient('c@example.com', 'Person C');
```

## Running Tests

### Composer Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (Unit + Integration tests)
composer test

# Run only Unit tests
composer test:unit

# Run only Integration tests
composer test:integration

# Run Unit and Integration tests sequentially
composer test:all

# Generate HTML coverage report (in coverage/ directory)
composer test:coverage
```

### Test Information

- **Unit Tests**: Tests for CurlClient, JSONClient, Mail classes
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests working with real APIs
- **EndToEndTest**: End-to-end test using all components together

### Using PHPUnit Directly

Instead of Composer commands, you can run PHPUnit directly:

```bash
# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Only Unit tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit

# Only Integration tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Integration

# Coverage report (Clover XML format)
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-clover coverage/clover.xml

# Coverage report (HTML format)
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage
```
**Windows users:** Replace `vendor/bin/phpunit` with `vendor\bin\phpunit.bat`
